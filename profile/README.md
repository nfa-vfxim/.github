Welcome to the Netherlands Filmacademy's Visual Effects & Immersive Media GitHub. Our [ShotGrid Configuration](https://github.com/nfa-vfxim/nfa-shotgun-configuration) and our adapted and custom apps reside here. Everything here was made or adapted by our VFX students to strengthen our VFX pipeline! It's all used on a daily basis during the creation of our student films. Feel free to look around, use, fork or create pull requests on all our repositories.
